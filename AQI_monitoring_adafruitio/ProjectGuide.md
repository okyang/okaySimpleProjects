# AQI Monitoring with Adafruit IO

Air Quality Index (AQI) uses pollutants such as Particulate Matter 2.5 microns (PM2.5) to indicate air quality. I will be using [Adafruit IO](https://io.adafruit.com/) and the [PM2.5 Air Quality Sensor and Breadboard Adapter Kit - PMS5003](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3686).
